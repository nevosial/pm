# Agile Manifesto
Uncovering better ways to developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Values unearthed using this approach :

1. ** Individuals and Interactions ** over process and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

Items in bold are valued slightly more than the ones they are compared to.
