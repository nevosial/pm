# Scrum Artifacts
They represent a work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

#### Product Backlog
- The product backlog is an ordered list of everything that is needed for the product and is the single source of requirements, features, functions, enhancements & fixes or any changes to be made to the product.
- The *Product Owner* is responsible for the Product backlog including its content, ordering and availability.
- This Product Backlog is never complete, it is dynamic and constantly changes to incorporate all that is needed by the product to be appropriate, competitive(in market) and useful.

#### Sprint Backlog
- The Sprint Backlog is a set of items selected for a Sprint including the delivery plan to achieve those items in the Sprint goal.
- It has details about the progress and is discussed in the *Daily Scrum*
- This artifact is maintained and relevant to the *Development team* and provides a real-time picture of the work that the development team plans to accomplish during the Sprint.


# Scrum Events

#### Sprint
- The Sprint is at the heart of the Scrum methodology. It is a time-box of *one month or less* during which a *"Done" , useable and potentially releaseable* product increment is created.
- Sprint contains and consists of
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Scrums
  - Development work
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- Sprints best have consistent durations through a development effort.
- A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of a previous sprint.
- As the Sprints are limited to one calendar month it thereby helps limiting the risk to *one month calendar cost.*

##### Sprint Planning
- The work is planned and this plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum team.
- Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.
- It is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to ensure the execution of the plan.

##### Daily Scrums
- The daily scrum is a *15-minute* time-boxed event for the Development team to synchronize the activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
- This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that can be done before the next one.
- The *Srum Master* is responsible to ensure that the *Daily Scrums* happen but it is the responsibility of the *development team* to condut the Daily Scrums.

##### Sprint Review
- This review is a time-boxed event held at the end of each Sprint. A *four* hour meeting is held for a *one month* long sprint.
- During this review the stakeholders collaborate on what was done during the Sprint and how it has added value to the Product Backlog and what more can be done to increase the value add.
- A review of the timeline, budget, and potential capabilities, marketplace for the next  anticipated product release.
- Attendees include Scrum Team, Stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
  - The Product Owner explains what has been 'Done' and what is pending to be done from the Product Backlog.  
  - *Development Team* demonstrates the work that has been 'done' and answers questions related to the increment.
  - A review of the timeline, budget, and potential capabilities, marketplace for the next  anticipated product release are completed during this time.

##### Sprint Retrospective
- A formal opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
